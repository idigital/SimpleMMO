# SimpleMMOG (SMOG: Simple Multiplayer Online Game)
A Simple Online Browser-based RPG Back-end built on PHP and MySQL.

## FEATURES
### Customizable:
The whole project is open-source, but you don't need to know even the basics of programming to create an amazing MMO. Nearly all the variables used are available in a little JSON file for you to mess around. There is also an [explanation for every variable](https://github.com/avinash-dwarapu/SimpleMMO/wiki/variables.json) in the wiki.

### Open-Source:
The project is far from complete and I would be really happy for anyone to fork the project and make it better. This also means anyone can improve or modify the files to suit their needs.
